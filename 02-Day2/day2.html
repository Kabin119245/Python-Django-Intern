  <b>This text is bold</b>, and <em>this text is emphasized</em>. Here is some
  text in an <i>alternate voice or mood</i>. For smaller text, use the
  <small>small tag</small>. The <strong>strong tag</strong> is for text that is
  very important. For scientific notation, H<sub>2</sub>O uses
  <sub>subscript</sub>, while E=mc<sup>2</sup> uses <sup>superscript</sup>. You
  can also <ins>insert new text</ins> and <del>delete unwanted text</del>.
  Finally, the <mark>marked or highlighted text</mark> can be used to draw
  attention.
